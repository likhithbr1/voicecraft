Project Title: Seamless Voice-Guided and Gesture-Controlled 3D Model Creation
Overview:
This project aims to revolutionize 3D model creation by seamlessly integrating voice commands and gesture controls. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies like the Web Speech API for speech recognition, Wit.ai API for natural language processing (NLP), and the Three.js JavaScript library for 3D modeling, our platform offers a user-friendly interface for designing 3D models with ease.

Key Features:
Voice Commands: Users can effortlessly manipulate 3D objects using intuitive voice commands. The Web Speech API accurately recognizes spoken instructions, allowing users to perform actions such as moving objects, rotating them, changing colors, resizing, and implementing undo/redo functionalities.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Through integration with the Wit.ai API, our system understands the intent behind voice commands, enabling fluid interaction and intuitive model manipulation.

Gesture Controls: In addition to voice commands, users can interact with the 3D models using gesture controls, enhancing the immersive experience and providing an alternative input method.

Applications:
Digital Prototyping: Designers and engineers can rapidly prototype ideas by verbally expressing design changes, accelerating the iteration process.

Education and Training: This platform can be utilized in educational settings to teach 3D modeling concepts in a hands-on and interactive manner, catering to diverse learning styles.

Accessibility: By incorporating voice and gesture controls, the system becomes more accessible to individuals with disabilities or those who prefer non-traditional input methods.

Virtual Environments: In virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications, users can create and manipulate 3D models in immersive environments, facilitating creative expression and simulation tasks.

Usage:
To utilize the platform, simply launch the application and grant access to the microphone and camera for voice and gesture recognition, respectively. Follow the on-screen instructions to issue voice commands or perform gestures to manipulate 3D objects in real-time.

Dependencies:
Web Speech API
Wit.ai API
Three.js JavaScript library
